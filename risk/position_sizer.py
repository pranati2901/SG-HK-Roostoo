# Inputs: trade_history (recent trade outcomes), current_capital (money now).
# Outputs: (fraction, size_usd) where fraction is % of money to bet.

# Numbers:
# - 1.0 means full size in TRENDING (trend is more reliable).

# - RISK_PER_TRADE = 0.005 means we prefer risking only 0.5% per trade.
# - ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER is used elsewhere as 1.5x ATR stop distance.
#
# ATR (Average True Range [average movement]) is how much price usually moves.
# If ATR is $500, then 1.5x ATR means $750 stop distance.
# If we are willing to lose $5,000 and stop distance is $750, we can buy
